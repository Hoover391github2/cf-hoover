# Pivotal Application Service > Hoover
 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pacphi/cf-hoover.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pacphi/cf-hoover) [![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/github/pacphi/cf-hoover/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/pacphi/cf-hoover)

> Status: Work-in-progress

You're already aware of and are using [cf-butler](https://github.com/pacphi/cf-butler) to help report on and manage application and service instances.  Wouldn't it be nice to easily aggregate reporting across multiple foundations? This is `cf-hoover`'s raison d'Ãªtre.


## Prerequisites

Required

* [Pivotal Application Service](https://pivotal.io/platform/pivotal-application-service) account


## Tools

* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 2.20.1 or better
* [JDK](http://openjdk.java.net/install/) 11 or better
* [cf](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) CLI 6.41.0 or better


## Clone

```
git clone https://github.com/pacphi/cf-hoover.git
```


## How to configure

Make a copy of then edit the contents of the `application.yml` file located in `src/main/resources`.  A best practice is to append a suffix representating the target deployment environment (e.g., `application-pws.yml`, `application-pcfone.yml`). You will need to provide administrator credentials to Apps Manager for the foundation if you want the butler to keep your entire foundation tidy.

> You really should not bundle configuration with the application. To take some of the sting away, you might consider externalizing and/or [encrypting](https://blog.novatec-gmbh.de/encrypted-properties-spring/) this configuration.

### Managing secrets

Place secrets in `config/secrets.json`, e.g.,

```
{
	"CF_BUTLERS": ["xxxxx", "xxxxx"]
}
```

We'll use this file later as input configuration for the creation of either a [credhub](https://docs.pivotal.io/credhub-service-broker/using.html) or [user-provided](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/user-provided.html#credentials) service instance.

> Replace occurrences of `xxxxx` above with appropriate values

### Minimum required keys

At a minimum you should supply values for the following keys

* `cf.butlers` -  an array of cf-butler routes (e.g., cf-butler-grateful-mouse.cfapps.io)

### General configuration notes

If you copied and appended a suffix to the original `application.yml` then you would set `spring.profiles.active` to be that suffix 

E.g., if you had a configuration file named `application-pws.yml`

```
./gradlew bootRun -Dspring.profiles.active=pws
```

> See the [samples](samples) directory for some examples of configuration when deploying to [Pivotal Web Services](https://login.run.pivotal.io/login) or [PCF One](https://login.run.pcfone.io/login).


## How to Build

```
./gradlew build
```


## How to Run with Gradle

```
./gradlew bootRun -Dspring.profiles.active={target_foundation_profile}
```
where `{target_foundation_profile}` is something like `pws` or `pcfone`

> You'll need to manually stop to the application with `Ctrl+C`


## How to deploy to Pivotal Application Service


### using scripts

Deploy the app (w/ a user-provided service instance vending secrets)

```
./deploy.sh
```

Deploy the app (w/ a Credhub service instance vending secrets)

```
./deploy.sh --with-credhub
```

Shutdown and destroy the app and service instances

```
./destroy.sh
```


## Endpoints

These REST endpoints have been exposed for administrative purposes.  

### User

```
GET /space-users
```
> Provides details and light metrics for users by role within all organizations and spaces across all registered foundations

Sample output
```
[
  {
    foundation: "pws"
    organization: "Northwest",
    space: "akarode",
    auditors: [ ],
    developers: [
      "wlund@pivotal.io",
      "akarode@pivotal.io"
    ],
    managers: [
      "wlund@pivotal.io",
      "akarode@pivotal.io"
    ],
    users: [
      "wlund@pivotal.io",
      "akarode@pivotal.io"
    ],
    user-count: 2,
  },
  {
    foundation: "pws"
    organization: "Northwest",
    space: "arao",
    auditors: [ ],
    developers: [
      "arao@pivotal.io"
    ],
    managers: [
      "arao@pivotal.io"
    ],
    users: [
      "arao@pivotal.io"
    ],
    user-count: 1
  },
...
```
> `users` is the unique subset of all users from each role in the organization/space

```
GET /space-users/{foundation}/{organization}/{space}
```
> Provides details and light metrics for users by role within a targeted foundation (alias), organization and space

```
GET /users
```
> Lists all unique user accounts across all registered foundations

```
GET /users/count
```
> Counts the number of user accounts across all registered foundations

### Snapshot

```
GET /snapshot/summary
```
> Provides summary metrics for applications, service instances, and users across all registered foundations

> **Note**: this summary report does not take the place of an official foundation Accounting Report. The Accounting Report is focussed on calculating aggregates (on a monthly basis) such as: (a) the total hours of application instance usage, (b) the largest # of application instances running (a.k.a. maximum concurrent application instances), c) the total hours of service instance usage and (d) the largest # of service instances running (a.k.a. maximum concurrent service instances).
